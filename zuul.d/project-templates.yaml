    # found in the Ubuntu releases they support.
    #
    #   Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Python 3.8
    #   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS - Python 3.10
    #   Ubuntu 24.04 LTS - Python 3.12
    #
    # As this template is only used from stable/2023.1 onwards, the minimum
    # Python version this template needs to support is Python 3.10 as early
    # releases of the charms are configured directly in each repository.
    #
    # This template should *not* be updated in-line with the agreed testing
    # runtimes for the rest of the OpenStack projects.

      Runs normal OpenStack PTI build jobs but publishes to
      `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org>`__ instead of
      `docs.openstack.org <https://docs.openstack.org>`__. This is
      intended for projects that are aiming to follow the PTI but are
      not official.

      To use this template you need to:

      #. add the ``openstackci`` user as an admin to your RTD project
      #. generate a webhook URL via the "Integrations" dashboard page
      #. provide the ``id`` in the ``rtd_webhook_id`` variable in your project

      For example

      .. code-block:: yaml

        project:
          name: openstack-project
          description: My Project
          templates:
            - docs-on-readthedocs
          vars:
            rtd_webhook_id: '1234'
