      Builds documentation using Sphinx per a previous version of the
      OpenStack PTI and then
      collects the results into the log directory so that they can be
      examined in their published form after a successful build.
      It runs the prepare-docs-for-afs role so that AFS stamp files
      can be examined if desired, and also validates htaccess files
      using the whereto tool.
